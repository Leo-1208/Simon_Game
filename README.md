# Simon Game

Welcome to the Simon Game repository! This project is a digital recreation of the classic electronic game of memory skill, "Simon". Test your memory as the game flashes sequences of colors and sounds that you must repeat. Each time you successfully replicate the correct sequence, the game progresses to a more challenging level.

## How to Play

- The Simon game consists of a series of tones and lights which require the player to remember the sequence.
- Once the game starts, pay attention to the pattern of lights and sounds.
- Your task is to reproduce the pattern by clicking on the colored pads in the correct order.
- If you succeed in matching the sequence correctly, the game will increment the pattern by one.
- The game continues in this fashion, becoming more complex with each level.
- If you fail to reproduce the sequence, the game will end or restart based on the settings.

## Features
